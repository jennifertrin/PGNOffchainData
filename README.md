# Enabling Public Goods Transactions Using Off-Chain Data

## Introduction
[Public Goods Network](https://publicgoods.network/) (PGN) is a low-cost Layer 2 built on top of Ethereum for supporting public goods. 

On most chains, gas fees paid are returned back to the chain, investors, and/or developers. However, on the PGN, gas fees are instead directed to a pool that funds the distribution of public goods.

PGN is like if Mastercard and Visa decided to utilize all the revenue they receive from processing transactions to fund public goods. Many businesses and network infrastructures already promise to share a portion of their profits with non-profit organizations and community projects. PGN takes it a step further by ensuring that all of the revenue generated from infrastructure usage goes directly to funding public goods.

PGN can empower the next generation of public goods funding by dedicating its entire ecosystem to public goods. It ensures that no third party is exploiting or profiting off of public goods infrastructure. It resolves these pain points:

- Government and non-profit organizations make various financial transactions that lead to the profits of misaligned for-profit organizations. Fees made on financial transactions related to public procurement and grant distribution are ensured that they are distributed for the greater good.
- All businesses can now develop corporate responsibility programs within the PGN. Many businesses are unable to contribute a high percentage of their revenue to public goods considering their low-profit margins. However, by participating in a network whose fees contribute to public goods, they can ensure that the fees that they normally pay are given back to the community.

It opens the doors to the following use cases:

- Public Goods DAOs
- On-chain Corporate Responsibility Programs
- Autonomous Digital Goods
    - An autonomous digital good can continue to exist, as long the general public finds it useful and continues to fund it

### Example #1: Trigger a Public Goods Transaction Based on Off-Chain Event

Use Case(s):

- A business or organization wants to donate to an organization after it has reached a milestone (ex. a higher education non-profit after x amount of their program students graduate from university)
- A business or organization wants to automatically pass a governance proposal after an off-chain event occurs (ex. a grant to fund highway repairs after x amount of commuters drive by it after x years)
